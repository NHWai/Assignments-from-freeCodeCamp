        Aung Cheint (also spelt Aung Cheimt), was a Burmese poet. He is
        considered one of the greatest Burmese poets. He is recognized as one of
        the modern poetry movement leaders, alongside Thukamein Hlaing, Maung
        Chaw Nwe and Phaw Way, in Myanmar. His famous works include Gandawin Ma
        Ma, Khin Khin Pyo Yay Saunt Khè Tae, and Athèzwè Gabyarsaya. He is
        acknowledged as the greatest living poet in Myanmar today. Along with
        Thukhamein Hlaing, and several others, he was at the vanguard of modern
        poetry in Myanmar, moving it from its traditional fixed rhyme to
        something much more free. This freedom is palpable in Aung Cheimt. He is
        the ultimate artistic free spirit, who brokers no compromise in his art,
        to which everything else must be subservient. He is the Marlon Brando
        and James Dean of Burmese poetry – though the comparisons are inaccurate
        because his aesthetic rebellion is always a moral one too: his fierce
        poetry brokers no compromise with either dishonesty or cowardice. He is
        the poet that all poets in Myanmar would like to emulate.
